In this project, we created a locker opening system of Bank locker, which consists of the following things :

1. We connected Keypad and Motor Driver IC to Raspberry Pi.
2. Dc Motor is then connected to Motor Driver IC which opens and closes the door based on commands.
3. The password entered in the keypad is then matched to the password stored in the server.
4. If the password is correct then the motor starts and opens the door.
5. If incorrect, it will show the wrong password and the motor will not start.


Note: We are using Thingspeak server to check the correct password
