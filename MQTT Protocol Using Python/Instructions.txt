=================================================================
MQTT is a publish/subscribe protocol that is lightweight and requires a minimal footprint and bandwidth to connect an IoT device. 
Unlike HTTPâ€™s request/response paradigm, MQTT is event driven and enables messages to be pushed to clients. This type of 
architecture decouples the clients from each other to enable a highly scalable solution without dependencies between data 
producers and data consumers.

The key benefits of MQTT are:

1.Lightweight and efficient to minimize resources required for the client and network bandwidth.
2.Enables bidirectional communication between devices and servers. Also, enabling broadcasting messages to groups of things.
3.Scales to millions of things.
4.Specifies Quality of Service (QoS) levels to support message reliability.
5.Supports persistent sessions between device and server that reduces reconnection time required over unreliable networks.
6.Messages can be encrypted with TLS and support client authentication protocols.

MQTT Clients:
There are many open source clients available in a wide range of programming languages. HiveMQ offers the HiveMQ MQTT Client that is developed in Java. 
Eclipse Paho also offers C/C++, Python and a variety of other implementations. A detailed list of clients can be found at mqtt.org.

MQTT Brokers:
MQTT brokers are offered in open source, commercial implementations and managed cloud services. HiveMQ offers two commercial editions: HiveMQ Professional and HiveMQ Enterprise, 
a managed cloud MQTT service: HiveMQ Cloud, and an open source version: HiveMQ Community Edition. A detailed list of brokers can be found at mqtt.org.
