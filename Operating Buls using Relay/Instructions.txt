Relay:

- A relay is a switch. Technically speaking, a relay is an electromagnetic switch where a small control signal (usually from a microcontroller) at the input of the Relay will control a high voltage supply (usually AC mains).

- Since this is a Raspberry Pi based project, let us talk with respect to Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi computer, although a powerful device, works on a 3.3V Logic.

- If you want this powerful computer to control your electrical loads, like an LED strip running along your garden or kitchen, you cannot interface them directly as the electrical loads work on AC Mains supply and the Raspberry Pi works on 3.3V DC (technically).

- Here comes the Relay. A simple electromechanical device that consists of a coil and few electrical contacts. When the coil is energized, it acts as an electromagnet and closes a switch. If the coil is de-energized, the coil loses its magnetic nature and releases the switch.

- So, by controlling the coil, you can control a switch, which in turn will control an electrical load. You can control the coil of the relay with the help of Raspberry Pi (although not directly, but with additional circuitry) as all you need is a small current to energize the coil.

- The following image shows a typical 5V Relay. It has 5 pins namely: NO (Normally Open), NC (Normally Closed), COMM (Common) and two coil terminals.

Relay Module:

- Even though the Relay Coil needs a small current in order to get energized, driving it directly from Raspberry Pi (for that matter, any Microcontroller like 8051 or Arduino) is not a good idea.

- A simple way is to drive the Relay Coil through a Transistor. The following image shows the connections required with respect to a Relay.

- If you have all these components, then you can build the circuit yourself. But if you feel that this might be tedious job, we have an alternative: a Relay Module.

- A Relay Module is a simple circuit board that consists of the relay itself and all the necessary components that are required to drive a relay and also the required connectors to connect the load.

- I have used a two channel relay module in this project. It is basically, two relays with all the circuitry on a single board.

How to Control a Relay using Raspberry Pi?

Till now, we have seen about relay, what is the necessity of relays, how relay works and also about relay modules. Now comes the interesting part i.e. How to Control a Relay using Raspberry Pi?

If you understood the concept of a relay, then it might be clear that all you need to do is to control the coil of the relay i.e. if the Raspberry Pi wants a load to be turned ON, then activate the relay by energizing the coil (sending a HIGH signal from Raspberry Pi).

Similarly, if the Raspberry Pi wants to turn the load OFF, then de-energize the coil by sending a LOW signal.
