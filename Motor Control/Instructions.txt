Motors are great for physical computing: they allow you to turn a wheel forwards and backwards, or make something spin around.

A motor can’t be controlled directly from the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins, because it needs a variable supply of 5 volts. This means you need to power it separately. However, motor controller add-on boards can be used to provide this functionality.

Controlling two motors from your Raspberry Pi using Python on the desktop. First, it’s best just to learn how to control the motor. Then, once you have it working, you could easily use your code to drive a Raspberry Pi-powered 
robot by detaching the monitor, mouse, and keyboard and building a robot around a chassis.

H bridge:
A motor can be driven forwards or backwards depending on which way around current flows through it. 
However, it would be awkward to have to rewire a motor, every time you want to change the direction it spins. 
To overcome this issue, motor controller boards include an H bridge. An H bridge uses 4 transistors to allow digital control of which way current flows through the motor. 
Most H bridges also contain flyback diodes. 
A flyback diode prevents the voltage spike that is generated by the motor when it is no longer powered (but still spinning) from damaging delicate electronics.

L298N Motor Driver Module:
In recent times, L298N Motor Driver Module has become the favorite choice of hobbyists and makers when it comes to DC Motor Control. It became so pop
ular that the module is now available at a very low cost.
