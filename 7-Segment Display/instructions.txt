In this we are using IR sensor to detect and count the numbers of objects and will display it on common anode 7-segment display

Step 1:- Connect the LED's negative terminal with the ground (GND) pin.

Step 2:- Give power to IR Sensor from Raspberry Pi Board's Vcc pin and connect the ground from GND pin

Step 3:- Connect the input pin of IR Sensor to pin number 5 (Declare it as input pin in the program)

Step 4:- Connect the 7-segment display pins according to the below data
            #           g   f   d   e   c   b   a
            ssd_pins = [31, 33, 35, 37, 40, 38, 36]

Step 5:- Run the program


=======================to print data (ASCII value)
set data mode (rs = 1)
set write mode (rw = 0)
set acsii data at data pins (data_pins = ASCII of character)

set clock pin high (en = 1)
wait for delay (10ms )
set clock low (en = 0)

========================to execute commands
set command mode (rs = 0)
set write mode (rw = 0)
set command at data pins (data_pins = lcd commands)

set clock pin high (en = 1)
wait for delay (10ms )
set clock low (en = 0)

===============================lcd commands
Initalization Commands-
		= 0x0C : lcd enable
		= 0x01 : lcd clear 
		= 0X38 : lcd 2 line mode
Positional Commands- 
		= 0x80 : 1st line 1st position
		= 0xc0 : 3rd line 1st position
